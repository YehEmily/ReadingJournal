    "3. Ruminating: \"Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime, semantic? What information can you get from the error messages, or from the output of the program? What kind of error could cause the problem youâ€™re seeing? What did you change last, before the problem appeared?\"\n",
